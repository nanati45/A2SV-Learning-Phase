# My Internship Projects - Web Development - at Eskalate

# Description

This repository contains some of the projects I developed during my internship as a web developer. Starting with foundational applications like a task management app, I advanced to building a full-featured job search website. Each project helped me apply and grow my skills in frontend and backend development using Next.js, Redux Toolkit, API integrations, and more.

# Project List

## 1. Task Management App

Basic task creation, editing, and deletion.
State management with Redux.

## 2. Job Search Website

Full-featured job search platform with dynamic search filters and application tracking.
Advanced Redux Toolkit Query for data fetching and caching.
Form validation for profile and application forms using React Hook Form and Zod.
